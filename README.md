# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This course contained two projects. This first project required the creation of pseudocode that encompassed the ability to print a list of all Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order as well as the ability to print the title and prerequisites of any course in the course list. In addition, the project required the evaluation of the run-time and memory of several data structures that could be used to address the requirements. Finally, based on the evaluation of each data structure, a recommendation was given for a specific data structure.

The second project involved creating code utilzing the recommended data structure that met several requirements. The requirements involved outputting a menu to the user that offered several options. The first option allowed the user to load the data structure with data from a file based on user input. The second option allowed the user to print out the full course list based on the data struture that was filled with the input file. The third option allowed the user to specifiy a specific course and printd the course title and prerequisites for the specified course.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
For each project, the approach that was taken involved careful consideration in regard to each requirement. For the first project, it was necessary to weigh the pros and cons of each data structure to determine the best fit for the requirements. Once a data structure was chosen, creating the code to address each requirement involved patience and proper coding etiquette. During each project, the importance of data structures became a common theme. Each data structure has strengths and weaknesses that are important to consider when choosing one for a specific scenario. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
While working on each project, there were moments of struggle and hardship that I had to work through. Each time that I encountered a set back, I stayed focused and determined. Keeping a positive outlook and staying committed allowed me to successfully complete each project.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Each project in this course allowed me to expand my knowledge of analysis and design. The work that each required has given me the wisdom to consider the affect that different data structures have on the overall efficiency of a program or application.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work that I put in on each project has only served to reinforce the positive behaviors that were already present in my work ethic. As always, writing efficient code that is well documented is paramount. In addition, learning to break down complex algorithms into smaller, more manageable functions has given me the ability to apply the same strategy to future projects.
